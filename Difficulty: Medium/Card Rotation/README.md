<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We perform this step until the last card.<br>If such an arrangement of decks is possible, output the arrangement, if it is not possible for a particular value of n then output -1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Examples:</strong></span></p>
<pre><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Input</strong>: n = 4
<strong>Output: </strong>[2, 1, 4, 3]
<strong>Explanation</strong>:
We initially have [2, 1, 4, 3]
Step1, we move the first card to the end. Deck now is: [1, 4, 3, 2]
Step2, we get 1. Hence we remove it. Deck now is: [4, 3, 2]
Step3, we move the 2 front cards one by one to the end  ([4, 3, 2] -&gt; [3, 2, 4] -&gt; [2, 4, 3]) Deck now is: [2, 4, 3].
Step4, we get 2. Hence we remove it. Deck now is: [4, 3]
Step5, the following sequence follows: [4, 3] -&gt; [3, 4] -&gt; [4, 3] -&gt; [3, 4]. Deck now is: [3, 4] </span><br><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Step6, we get 3. Hence we remove it. Deck now is: [4] Finally, we're left with a single card and thus, we stop. </span></pre>
<pre><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Input : </strong>n = 3<strong><br>Output:</strong> [3, 1, 2]<strong><br>Explanation:<br></strong>We intially have [3, 1, 2]<br>Step1, we move the first card to the end .Deck now is : [1, 2, 3]<br>Step2, we get 1.Hence we remove it .Deck now is : [2,3]<br>Step3, we move the 2 front card on e by one to the end ([2,3] -&gt; [3,2] -&gt; [2,3]) Deck now is : [2, 3].<br>Step4, we get 2 .Hence we remove it.
